This is a detailed walkthrough of the steps taken to migrate a dataset from a RDBMS (SQL) to a NoSQL DBMS.

The dataset provided was a modified version from Open Flights dataset. It consists of 6,162 airlines, 7,184 airports, connected by 67,663 routes. There are also 6,649 cities located in 260 countries.

The intended use for the dataset is building a flight comparison website, where information about flights can be queried easily and with minimum response time and allow for flexibility of modifications that may be applied later to the dataset.

The report discusses the current solutionâ€™s drawbacks, reasons for migration, the process of choosing a suitable DBMS system and a demonstration for that system in action.
